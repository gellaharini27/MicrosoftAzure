# Microsoft Azure
**Fundamentals of Azure**

**WHAT IS MICROSOFT AZURE?**

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform offered by Microsoft. It provides accessibility, administration, and the creation of applications and services across worldwide data centers. Additionally, it offers a variety of functionalities, encompassing software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Microsoft Azure accommodates various programming languages, tools, and frameworks, inclusive of Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. 

**SaaS(software as a service)**

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. With SaaS, you don't need to install or maintain the software on your local devices. Instead, you can use the applications directly through a web browser.

Microsoft Azure offers a variety of SaaS solutions, covering different aspects of business and productivity.For Example,Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365),Dynamics 365,Azure DevOps.

**Benefits of Saas**

**Accessibility**: Users can access the applications from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Scalability**: SaaS applications can scale easily to accommodate changing user demands.

**Automatic Updates**: Microsoft manages updates and maintenance, ensuring that users always have access to the latest features and security patches.

**PaaS(platform as a service)**

PaaS is a cloud computing service that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of underlying infrastructure.By using PaaS in Microsoft Azure, developers can focus on writing code and building features without the need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, making application development more efficient and agile.
